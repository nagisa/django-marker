# django-marker

## Why?

First of all, `contrib.markup`
[is getting deprecated](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/18054), it has
issues with security and rendering.

It is a pretty good time to start this project to avoid a panic of community,
when actual deprecation warning appears in release notes.

## What do I get?

Our primary goal is to provide template tags for same three markups that are
provided by `contrib.markup`.

## How to use?
